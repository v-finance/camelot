    Interface for a naming context, which consists of methods for

    Names
    -----
    Each name passed as an argument to a context method should be relative to that context.
    This can be both an atomic string name, for binding on the context itself,
    or composite names (composed of multiple atomic parts), for binding through subcontexts using the recursive resolve.
    Internally, a context always uses the composite form of names, even when provided with atomic values.

    Each context also keeps track of its fully qualified composite name, once it gets bound to another context.
    This composite name is always relative to the initial naming context :see: camelot.core.naming.InitialNamingContext.
    The context uses this name to compose and return the fully qualified name of created bindings,
    which can thus be used to resolve them afterwards on the initial naming context.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    All the methods in this interface can throw a NamingException or any of its subclasses.
