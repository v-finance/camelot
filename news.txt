Development
-----------

 * A single source base for both Python 2.7 and Python 3.3

 * A single source base for both PyQt4 and PySide, select the appropriate binding by
   setting the `CAMELOT_QT_API` environment variable, see :ref:`faq-pyside`
 
 * The application itself is an action : :class:`camelot.admin.action.application.Application`.
   This makes it easy to customize the startup process by overwritting its `model_run` method.
  
 * Modified progress dialog to add and clear details while the action runs.
 
 * Default sizes for forms are calculated, avoiding the need of setting the `form_size` attribute
   on the `Admin` class.
 
 * The `OneToMany` editor can display query attributes, created with `lazy='dynamic'`.
 
 * The `count` query no longer uses subselects, reducing the time needed to build
   up an initial table view on databases that are slow when handling subselects,
   such as MySQL.

 * New available actions :
 
   * Start and stop a profiler
   * Change authentication picture
 
 * New action steps :
 
   * :class:`camelot.view.action_steps.item_view.OpenTableView`
   * :class:`camelot.view.action_steps.select_file.SaveFile`
   * :class:`camelot.view.action_steps.select_file.SelectDirectory`

   * :class:`camelot.view.action_steps.application.MainWindow`
   * :class:`camelot.view.action_steps.form_view.ToFirstForm`
   * :class:`camelot.view.action_steps.form_view.ToLastForm`
   * :class:`camelot.view.action_steps.form_view.ToNextForm`
   * :class:`camelot.view.action_steps.form_view.ToPreviousForm`
 
 * Reworked import/export action to handle tables with many columns
 
 * New database profiles api
 
 * Integer and float editors display `None` as an empty string
 
 * The `list_action` state used to determine the icon in a table view
 
 * Delayed primary key type definition in default models

 * Introduction of the :class:`camelot.admin.field_admin.FieldAdmin` class to
   allow definition of the field attributes within the entity class.

 * See :ref:`migrate-latest` for documentation on how to upgrade an 
   existing Camelot project to the latest version.

 * The :class:`camelot.model.batch_job.BatchJob` is reworked to have more robust error handling, and
   a batch job becomes useable as a context manager
 
 * Decouple the :class:`camelot.core.memento.SqlMemento` from :class:`camelot.model.memento.Memento`,
   so the change tracking system becomes customizable.
   
 * List of changes can be accessed from the form view
 
 * Support for using an existing database through SQLAlchemy reflection

 * Primary key columns are not editable by default
