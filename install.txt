This SDK is a Python distribution targeted at the development and deployment of QT
based applications.  This all in one installation of Camelot with all its
dependencies is available in the `shop <http://www.conceptive.be/shop.html>`_.

=============================

First, make sure you have setup tools installed, `Setup tools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_.
If you are using a debian based distribution, you can type::

  sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

Then use easy_install to install Camelot, under Linux this would be done by typing::

  sudo easy_install camelot

Linux distributions often offer packages for various applications, including
Camelot and its dependencies :

 * `OpenSUSE build service  <https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=home%3Afrispete%3APyQt>`_.

You need to make sure Camelot and all its dependencies are in the **PYTHONPATH**
before you start using it.

Verifiy the installation
========================

To verify if you have Camelot installed and available in the **PYTHONPATH**, fire up a
python interpreter::

  python

  >>> import camelot
  >>> print camelot.__version__
  >>> import sqlalchemy
  >>> print sqlalchemy.__version__
  >>> import PyQt4
  
None of them should raise an ImportError.
