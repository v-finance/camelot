All in one Windows installer
============================

When working on Windows, the easiest way to get up and running is through
the `Conceptive Python SDK <http://www.conceptive.be/python-sdk.htm>`_.

This SDK is a Python distribution targeted at the development and deployment of QT
based applications.  This all in one installation of Camelot with all its
dependencies is available in the `shop <http://www.conceptive.be/shop.html>`_.

From the Python Package Index
=============================

First, make sure you have setup tools installed, `Setup tools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_.
If you are using a debian based distribution, you can type::

  sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

Then use easy_install to install Camelot, under Linux this would be done by typing::

  sudo easy_install camelot

Packages
========

Linux distributions often offer packages for various applications, including
Camelot and its dependencies :

 * `OpenSUSE build service  <https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=home%3Afrispete%3APyQt>`_.

From source
===========

When installing Camelot from source, you need to make sure all dependencies
are installed and available in your **PYTHONPATH**.
 
**Dependencies**

Notice that bugs in QT 4.6 and PyQt 4.7 may cause a Camelot application
to crash, so newer versions of those libraries are required.

 * QT 4.7
 * PyQt 4.8 `PyQt Website <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/>`_
 * SQLAlchemy 0.6.5 `SQLAlchemy Website <http://www.sqlalchemy.org>`_
 * Elixir 0.7.1 `Elixir Website <http://elixir.ematia.de/>`_
 * sqlalchemy-migrate 0.7.1
 * Jinja2 2.5.5
 * chardet 1.0.1 
 * xlwt 0.7.2 
 * xlrd 0.5.2
                        
**Releases**

The source code of a release can be downloaded from the 
`Python Package Index <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Camelot/>`_ and then
extracted::

  tar xzvf Camelot-10.07.02.tar.gz

**Trunk**

The latest and greatest version of the source can be checked out
from the subversion repository::

  svn co http://guest:guest@repository.conceptive.be/camelot/svn/trunk/
  
**Adapting PYTHONPATH**

You need to make sure Camelot and all its dependencies are in the **PYTHONPATH**
before you start using it::

  export PYTHONPATH=/home/username/Camelot-10.07.02
  
or::

  export PYTHONPATH=/home/username/Camelot-10.07.02:path to sqlalchemy:path to elxir:...
  
Verifiy the installation
========================

To verify if you have Camelot installed and available in the **PYTHONPATH**, fire up a
python interpreter::

  python
  
and issue these commands::

  >>> import camelot
  >>> print camelot.__version__
  >>> import sqlalchemy
  >>> print sqlalchemy.__version__
  >>> import elixir
  >>> print elixir.__version__
  >>> import PyQt4
  
None of them should raise an ImportError.
